## A Guide to Entering the Field
*[https://80000hours.org/articles/ml-engineering-career-transition-guide/](https://80000hours.org/articles/ml-engineering-career-transition-guide/)*


This is the article I came across when researching how realistic a transition from being a Software Engineer to either a Machine Learning Engineer or Research position is. To no one's surprise really, it turns out that (granted some luck is always required) it is entirely possible to join top level machine learning teams without needing to get a PhD in the topic, granted you're willing to put in the work. That is the key though - **it's going to take a lot of work.**

> Once you know the 101-level basics of ML, the next thing to learn is how to implement and debug ML algorithms. (Based on the experiences of others in the community who have taken this path, we expect this to take at minimum 200 hours of focused work, and likely more if you are starting out with less experience).

The article goes into more detail about the possible path that you could take to make the career transition (this is what I've based my path on so far), and encourages you to start reaching out to companies working on your area of interest sooner than you might otherwise think.

>You should strongly consider contacting the teams you’re interested in at this stage. Send them an email with the specifics of what you’re planning on spending your time on to get feedback on it. The manager of the team may suggest specific resources to use, and can help you avoid wasting time on extraneous skills you don’t need for the role.

To give you a better idea of what it is like to be a Machine Learning Engineer/Researcher however, it links two articles that I would highly suggest reading.

### Reproducing Deep Reinforcement Learning

This is a longer post that details the struggles involved with trying to implement a RL research paper. The key takeaways I had were:
 - Reinforcement Learning is hard, and it's hard in a very different way than typical software engineering.
 - Expect to get stuck and explore many dead ends with very little hint to whether you're going in the correct direction or not.
 - The only hints you're going to get are very small moments of confusion where things just feel off.
 - A good approach to solving problems in this space is spend a lot more time forming thorough hypotheses rather than trying to rapidly iterate on an idea.
 - Since iterations take significantly longer, and you'll be exploring many different areas, the more detailed your notes and logs are, the better. You'll be regularly referencing work you did two weeks ago or longer, and there's no way you can keep everything in your head.
 - These projects will take a lot longer than you think, and the areas that take more time aren't the ones you thought they were going to be.
 - This type of exercise is better practice for Machine Learning Engineering than Research, but still valuable for both.

### Why Is Machine Learning 'Hard'?
*[http://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/why-is-machine-learning-hard.html](http://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/why-is-machine-learning-hard.html)*

A short post that is more illustrative of why machine learning can be exponentially more difficult than typical software engineering. It outlines the typical debugging problemspace for a software engineering to be a n<sup>2</sup> process, whereas debugging machine learning applications is an n<sup>4</sup> process.

To summarize it in one line: 

_Fast and effective debugging is the hardest and most important skill to master for an aspiring machine learning engineer._
